# Chapter 2

## Section 2.1
### pun.c

In section 2.1, the goal is to find an IDE and properly preprocess, compile, and link a simple program. <br />
+ Preprocessing: The program is first given to a preprocessor, which obeys commands that begin with a directive, ie #include.
+ Compiling:  The compiler translates the program into machine instructions, object code.
+ Linking: The linker combines the object code produced by the compiler with any additional code needed to yield a complete executable program.

-------
The GCC compiler is a popular C compiler supplied with Linux distributions.

There are Linux-Compatible Environments and Compilers available.
* For Windows: Install Linux with WSL
* Apple macOS/OSX is based on the BSD version of UNIX; however, often developers use the Homebrew tool to install additional Linux-style utilities.
